Brython-Playground
==========

This is an interactive HTML/CSS/JS playground similar to jsFiddle, jsBin, CodePen and the likes but much simpler with only the basic features.

Diffenent from it's sister project, playground (which was based on the work of the CSSDeck Author, [Rishabh](http://codetheory.in/about/)) this project is focused towards [Brython](http://brython.info/) which basically is Python for Browsers.


To use it, clone or download and unzip the project and start a local webserver (like `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`).
